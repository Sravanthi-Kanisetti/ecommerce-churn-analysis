## 📌 What is Silent Drift?

In e-commerce, most customers don't cancel — they simply **stop buying**.  
No warning. No complaint. No goodbye.  
This is called **Silent Churn** — and it costs businesses millions.

This project answers:
- How many customers silently exited — and how much revenue did we lose?
- Which customers are about to exit next?
- What behaviour patterns predict a silent exit?
- How do we stop it before it happens?

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Highlights

All cleaning done using `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` in BigQuery.  
Raw data is **never modified** — cleaning creates a separate `clean_customers` table.

| Column | Issue Found | Fix Applied |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `email` | Nulls, missing @, junk values | CASE + LIKE + IN checks |
| `phone` | Mixed formats (+91-XXXXX), short numbers | REGEXP_REPLACE + RIGHT(10) |
| `gender` | M/F/0/1/male/MALE formats | UPPER + CASE standardization |
| `age` | Impossible values (0, -1, 150, 999) | NULL out invalid range |
| `membership_tier` | Typos: Sivler, G0ld, Platinium | LOWER + IN list matching |
| `total_spent_inr` | Negatives, zero with orders | ABS() for negatives, NULL for zeros |
| `avg_order_value_inr` | Missing but calculable | Recalculate from spent ÷ orders |
| `total_returns` | Returns > Orders (impossible) | Cap at total_orders |
| `avg_product_rating` | Values outside 1–5 range | NULL out invalid |
| `duplicates` | ~1,575 duplicate records | ROW_NUMBER() + QUALIFY |
